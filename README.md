# Human-Activity-Recognition
Data Analysis on Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset
==================================================
## Background

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.

## Objective

The goal of the project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. The outcome variable is the "classe" variable in the training dataset. A detailed report on how to built the model, cross validation, expected out of sample error, and choices made to clean the dataset is presented. The machine learning algorithms are implemented and then compared based on the test dataset.
